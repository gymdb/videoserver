# Docker

For a quick-start we now provide a simple docker-compose.yml file. Be aware that this is just for demo purposes. 
To get started

1.) Install docker and docker compose

2.) Download the Docker folder

3.) Run docker-compose up -d 
    On port 80 you will find the videoserver
    On port 8080 you will find phpmyadmin, which of course has a link to the videoserver database
    
4.) Be aware that videos need to be in the appropriate format. (mp4,web,ogg)    - see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5_video for more details.
